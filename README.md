# Mark's Portfolio

I built my personal portfolio with the following tools:

- Front-end library: React
- CSS framework: React-bootstrap
- CSS animations library: Animate.css

I used the [React App docs ](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) and [Animate CSS docs](https://animate.style/) as guides:

My portfolio includes the following tabs/sections:
- navigation bar
- home / banner
- skills
- projects
- footer

In this portfolio, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
